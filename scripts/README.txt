Scripts used for the Tittensor et al. (2014) (Science) Aichi analysis

Common functions - code common to both dynamic linear model and signal to noise scripts
Dynamic linear models - code to run the dynamic linear model fits
Multimodel averaging parametric - code to run the multimodel averaging parametric fits
Signal to noise - code to run the signal-to-noise estimators
Visualisation (inc games) - code to produce plots for images in the paper. Includes code to fit GAMs (used in Fig. S55). Note that the DLM and multimodel models must be run (to fill the results folder) prior to running these scripts.
